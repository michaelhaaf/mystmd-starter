# mystmd [#2678](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2678)

I initially had different results when testing `mystmd` that had been installed using `npm` vs `pip`,
so I've split this into two directories. That turned out to be a setup issue -- there's no 
difference in behavior between the two installs.

But, what's done is done; see the READMEs in the `using_npm` and `using_pypi` directories for more information.
